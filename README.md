# neural_net

For verifying the neural network implementation there are 2 test files, [backprop_example1.py](./backprop_example1.py) and [backprop_example2.py](./backprop_example2.py). These files initialize a neural networks with the predefined weights and parameters as set out in the supplemental material. Thees files will compute the loss of the neural network with the given inputs, and with verbose logging output the intermediate values for verification. The output of these files can be seen in [backprop_example1.txt](./resources/backprop_example1.txt) and [backprop_example2.txt](./resources/backprop_example2.txt).

There are executable files for each dataset examined in this homework, `wdbc.py`, `loan.py`, and `raisins.py`. Each of these files will perform a hyperparameter search, identifying the best regularization strength and neural network architecture for the dataset. After identifing the optimal values, the code will then train the best model on varying sample lengths of the training data, and compute the loss of the network against the test set. Once the full training set is used, the code will plot the test loss as a function of the number of training samples given to the network.
